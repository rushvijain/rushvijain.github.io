# Hi, I am Rushvi

...and I am a software engineer

I have 6 years of experience working as a software engineer and currently I am working with JP Morgan Chase & Co. 
I am a Java person but I enjoy learning new technologies. I do a lot of backend coding at my job and I am excited to tap into frontend technologies like React.

When I am not working, I am on my bed reading books. Sometimes I like to review them, you can find one here: https://theblahcksheep.com/rear-reads/why-i-read-classics/

I enjoy going on runs, hikes and train journeys.
